# Magnetic Levitation Toy

Object that horizonally levitates, artwork inspired
by flying a rocket to the Moon and back.

Magnets compensate vertical component of gravity and
provide forward horizontal force (thrust) that is 
compensated with a thread (rocket is anchored to the Moon).

3D printable parts and 6 cylindrical neodymium magnets 
D=10 mm, L=10 mm.
