# Magnetic Levitation Toy

Object that horizonally levitates, artwork inspired
by flying a rocket to the Moon and back.

Magnets compensate vertical component of gravity.
A small horizontal force component still remains. 
For stability it can be countered with a thread.

3D printable parts and 6 cylindrical neodymium magnets 
r=10 mm, h=10 mm.
