# Magnetic Levitation Toy

Object that horizonally levitates, artwork inspired
by flying a rocket to the Moon and back.

Magnets counter the gravity and provide forward
horizontal force (thrust) that is compensated
with a thread (rocket is anchored to the Moon).

3D printable parts, M3 threaded stainless steel rod
and 6 round (cylinder) neodymium magnets (0.5 T, grade N35).

    D =  6 mm, L = 10 mm, rod 14 mm
    D = 10 mm, L = 10 mm, rod 25 mm
    D = 12 mm, L = 12 mm, rod 25 mm

Range of mechanical stability is very narrow.
Millimeter precison adjustment is required to make
it right.
